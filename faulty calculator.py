#Exercise
#Design a calculator which will correctly solve all the problems except..
#..the following ones
#  45 * 3 = 555, 56 + 9 = 77,  56/6=4
# ...Your program should take operator and the two numbers as input from user and return the result

#print ('enter 1st number')
a1st = int (input ())
print ('enter second number')
a2nd = int (input ())
print ('choose any operation')
print ('multiply')
print ('add')
print ('divide')
print('subtract')
multiply = a1st * a2nd
add = a1st + a2nd
divide =a1st / a2nd
subtract = a1st - a2nd
result1 = a1st * a2nd
print (input(result1))
